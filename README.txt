# Final Lab Exam - Magic Square (Samuel Gamelin)

I completed this lab examination by using Maven as the build tool for the project.

My submission (one zip file) includes a runnable jar file (which in turn also includes the source code),
this README file, and a zip archive (project.zip) of the entire Maven project and the underlying files, which includes
again all source code along with the tests for the model as well as the UML class diagram.

Inside the zip archive (project.zip, which contains all project files (including pom.xml)):
 1. The tests for the model can be found under the src/test/java/model directory.
 2. The UML class diagram can be found under the documentation/uml directory as the "classDiagram.png" file.

Additional notes:
- The constant that determines the size of the game is located in the MagicSquareModel class.
